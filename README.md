Project Name: Climeè — A Classy Temperature Converter

What’s the goal?
To create a temperature converter that’s not just useful, but also looks elegant and unique — inspired by classic, timeless design. It lets users convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit easily, while feeling polished and different from usual apps.

What tools did I use?
HTML to build the page layout
CSS for styling with a rare, rich color scheme and smooth animations
JavaScript to handle the temperature calculations, input checks, and interactivity
Fancy fonts from Google Fonts to give that sophisticated touch

How did I build it?
Planned out the features: input box, unit selection, convert button, and result display with animation.
Designed the look with carefully chosen colors and fonts to feel upscale and eye-catching.
Coded the HTML structure and styled it using CSS for a smooth, refined interface.
Wrote JavaScript to check if the user input is valid, convert temperatures correctly, show results dynamically, and reset inputs when needed.
Tested everything to make sure it works well on different screen sizes and browsers.

What did I achieve?
Made a tool that’s easy to use but stands out thanks to its unique, classy design.
Created a smooth experience where users get instant, clear feedback.
Built the whole thing with clean code that’s easy to maintain or improve.
Added subtle animations and stylish elements that give it a high-end feel — perfect for showcasing frontend skills or adding to a portfolio.
